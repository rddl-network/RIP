# REP-18: Investing in tokenized machine outputs
## Abstract
This REP defines how the output of a machine is tokenized and represented as RDDL Productivity Tokens (i.e: RDDP). The projected output marks the total amount of RDDP issued by one machine over its lifetime, while the actual output defines the issued RDDP after a period of time. Token owners can invest in fractional claims to a projected machine output and either participate in the machines output or sell their fractional claims at a later stage.

## Motivation
The RDDL network aims to provide a convenient way of investing in renewable energy projects with clear staking and interest benefits. 

## Problem breakdown
- Machines that are registered to the RDDL network are expected to either produce or consume energy. 
- When a machine is registered it can also attest its projected output.
- Token owners can invest in claims on future machine output
- Projected output is issued as token on an extended proof of productivity and aliqout shares are issued to claim holders

## Solution

## Questions
- How are projected outputs stored and verified?
- How is the extended proof of productivity structured?
- What happens if the machine breaks before it has produced its projected output?
- How to connect other networks for seamless investment
