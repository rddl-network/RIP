# REP-18: Investing in tokenized machine outputs
## Abstract
This REP defines the methodology for tokenizing the output of a machine and representing it as RDDL Productivity Tokens (RDDP). The projected output represents the total amount of RDDP issued by a machine over its lifetime. Conversely, the actual output reflects the issued RDDP after a specific period. Token holders can invest in fractional claims to a machine's projected output, participating in the machine's productivity or selling their fractional claims later.

## Motivation
The RDDL network aims to provide a streamlined and transparent method for investing in renewable energy projects. This system offers clear staking and interest benefits, enabling investors to support sustainable initiatives while potentially gaining returns on their investments

## Problem breakdown
The core challenges addressed in this proposal include:

- **Machine Registration and Energy Production/Consumption:** Machines registered with the RDDL network are expected to either produce or consume energy. Upon registration, machines can also declare their projected output.

- **Investment in Future Output:** Token owners can invest in claims on a machine's future output, receiving tokens representing fractional shares of the projected productivity.

- **Token Issuance Based on Actual Output:** Actual output is tokenized as RDDP through an extended proof of productivity mechanism, with aliquot shares distributed to claim holders accordingly.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves several key components:

- **Tokenization of Machine Outputs:** Establishing a system where the output of registered machines is tokenized into RDDL Productivity Tokens (RDDP). This tokenization will be based on verified machine output over a specific period.

- **Investment Mechanism:** Allowing investors to purchase fractional claims on a machine's future output. This mechanism enables investors to participate in the machine's productivity or trade their claims in the secondary market.

- **Verification and Storage of Projected Outputs:** Robust methods to store and verify the projected outputs of machines.

- **Extended Proof of Productivity:** Developing a structured approach to the extended proof of productivity. This mechanism will ensure that token issuance accurately reflects the machine's output over a specific time period.

- **Risk Management:** Addressing potential risks, such as machine failure, by outlining procedures for handling instances where a machine does not meet its projected output.

- **Network Integration:** Ensuring seamless connectivity with other networks to facilitate smooth and efficient investments. This can be achieved via USDT using the Thether protocol.

## Questions
- How are projected outputs stored and verified?
- How is the extended proof of productivity structured?
- What happens if the machine breaks before it has produced its projected output?
- How to connect other networks for seamless investment
